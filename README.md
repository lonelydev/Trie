# Trie

## Introduction

Check out the definition of Trie in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)

Tries are a special category of Tree data structures that can be used to store strings for quick lookups. 
This is because the worst case lookup is better than an imperfect hash table.

Common usecase is to implement a word Dictionary. 

## Implementation

So many different ways to implement a trie though I've chosen the way that I understood 
from [Tushar Roy's youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXjmTQ8LEoI). 
This seemed to me as the easiest to understand and implement.

The Trie project has the implementation of Insert, Delete and Search. Insert and Search both have their Iterative and Recursive implementations separately. 
The Trie class can be initialized with either Iterative/Recursive implementations. 

The TrieTester project has some basic tests done on the Trie class.
